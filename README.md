RazPiCECServer
==============

Raspberry Pi supports CEC over HDMI, so I started building a web server to contain buttons like "xBox" or "TV" <br>
that would take the connected TV from any state, including turned off, to the selected state. <br>

As school started however, I had to leave my parents' TV (much more expensive than my own and supports CEC) <br>
only to find that my TV does not support CEC, putting the project on hiatus for a while.
